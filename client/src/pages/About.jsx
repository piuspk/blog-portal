              Welcome to Piyush's Blog! This blog was created by Piyush Kumar 
              as a personal project to share his thoughts and ideas with the
              world.

              I am a web development enthusiast with expertise in the MERN stack
              and Next.js frameworks. I specialize in building dynamic and scalable
              applications, leveraging modern technologies to create seamless user
              experiences. My strong foundation in C++ and competitive programming
              has sharpened my problem-solving skills, particularly in data structures
              and algorithms like graphs and linked lists. In addition to web
              development, I have experience in graphic design, using tools such
              as Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom to enhance the visual appeal of my
              projects.
